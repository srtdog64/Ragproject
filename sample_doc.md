# Sample RAG Documentation

## Introduction

This is a sample markdown document for testing the RAG system's file loading capabilities.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI architecture that combines:
- **Retrieval Systems**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
- **Generative Models**: Producing coherent responses based on retrieved context
- **Vector Databases**: Storing and searching document embeddings efficiently

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processing
Documents are processed through several stages:
1. **Ingestion**: Loading documents into the system
2. **Chunking**: Breaking documents into manageable pieces
3. **Embedding**: Converting text into vector representations
4. **Indexing**: Storing vectors in a searchable database

### 2. Retrieval Pipeline
The retrieval process involves:
- Query embedding
- Similarity search
- Result reranking
- Context compression

### 3. Generation
The generation phase combines:
- Retrieved context
- User query
- LLM processing
- Response formatting

## Benefits of RAG

RAG systems provide several advantages:

- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Responses are grounded in actual documents
- **Up-to-date Information**: Can incorporate new documents without retraining
- **Transparency**: Can cite sources and show evidence
- **Domain Adaptation**: Works well for specialized knowledge bases

## Example Use Cases

1. **Customer Support**: Answer questions based on product documentation
2. **Research Assistant**: Find and summarize relevant papers
3. **Knowledge Management**: Navigate large corporate knowledge bases
4. **Educational Tools**: Provide accurate answers from textbooks and materials

## Technical Details

### Vector Similarity
RAG systems typically use cosine similarity to find relevant documents:

```python
def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):
    dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)
    norm_a = np.linalg.norm(vec1)
    norm_b = np.linalg.norm(vec2)
    return dot_product / (norm_a * norm_b)
```

### Chunking Strategies
- Fixed-size chunking with overlap
- Semantic chunking based on paragraphs
- Recursive text splitting
- Document-aware chunking

## Conclusion

RAG represents a significant advancement in AI systems, combining the best of retrieval and generation to provide accurate, contextual responses.
